I hope you enjoy this easy Sushi Rice recipe!\n\nIngredients:\nHow to Make Sushi Rice That Even Works for Sushi\nI don&#39;t make sushi at home very often, or ever, since we&#39;re\nsurrounded by top-notch sushi chefs here in San Francisco, but that doesn&#39;t\njust about any grilled meat, and since it&#39;s perfectly fine at room temperature,\nit&#39;s great for picnics.\nYou can even turn it into some quick tortilla-less tacos\nusing nori seaweed wraps, as seen in the video. They make for such a unique\nsummer meal – the perfect delivery system for any and all leftovers. I even\nseen it rolled into balls, and tossed in toasted sesame seeds, or seaweed, and\nserved like truffles.\nWhat I&#39;m trying to say is, you can do a lot with this stuff.\nIncluding sushi. There are thousands of videos on YouTube showing how to make\nliterally every type of sushi in existence, so check those out if you&#39;re so\ninclined. Maybe one of these days I&#39;ll even give it a go, if only for the “constructive\ncriticism.” I really hope you give this sushi\nrice technique a try soon.

                    &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Vegan sushi burrito recipe! Easy vegan crab sushi and vegan veggie sushi burritos that quick, easy, healthy, and perfect for dinner on a busy weeknight! Full recipe and where I buy my ingredients below :) \n\nVegan Sushi Burrito\n(Makes 2 burritos)\n\n2 large tortillas\n1 tsp wasabi powder mixed with 1 tsp hot water\n3-4 sheets dried seaweed \n1/4 cup dry white rice\n1/4 cup dry quinoa \n1 cup water\n\nveggies of your choice. I like:\n- mixed greens\n- cucumbers\n- avocado \n- snap peas\n- shelled edamame \n\n- 1 tbsp soy sauce\n- 1 tsp rice wine vinegar \n- 1 tsp agave \n- 2 drops sesame oil \n\nGardein Crab-less Crab Cakes \n- I used 3 per roll, baked until warmed through and cut in half\n\nIn a sauce pan, add rice, quinoa, and 1 cup of water. Bring to boil then reduce heat to low and cover for 15-20 minutes or until rice is soft and all of the water is absorbed. Then remove from heat and fluff with a fork.\n\nMeanwhile, make wasabi paste by mixing wasabi powder and water. Set aside. Then chop up veggies of your choice.\n\nWarm tortilla slightly then spread a thin layer of wasabi paste down the center. Then layer seaweed, rice, veggies, crab cakes if using, and a spoon or two of sauce (reserve the rest for dipping!) \n\nTuck in the sides of the tortilla and roll. Cut if desired and serve along side a green salad :)\n\n******* As I mentioned in the video, the Gardein crab cakes can be found in the freezer section at Target, Whole Foods, and sometimes places like Costco and local health food stores also carry them :)\n\nWasabi powder can be found in most grocery stores in the International section. Sometimes they even have a remade version. \n\nSeaweed can also be found in a lot of grocery stores in the International section. I got this roasted kind at Trader Joes :) Whole Foods has seaweed too!***********\n\n\nMore MissVranHalen VIDEOS MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nVEGAN Apple Pie Pancakes (oil-free) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldZNNLXjqgU\n\nSweet Potato + Pecan Salad with Cranberries and DIY Dressing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2eNGY5EZGI\n\nMy Morning Routine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65jH5NXiP_s\n\nVegan Cookie Taste Test with Dani: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt1W0ANrs1o\n\nWhen the Person You&#39;re Dating Doesn&#39;t Share Your Belief&#39;s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLSKHtIv54A \n\nThe Reason You Always Feel Tired + Have No Energy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-Jd_YkqQOw \n\nMeal Prep with Me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XS1LFD8g5s\n\nWhat I Ate Today: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElWCNsVx2rI\n\nMake sure you&#39;re subscribed to my YouTube channel to keep up with my future videos!
